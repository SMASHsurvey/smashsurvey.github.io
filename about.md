### Description

The Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH) used the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to map 480 square degrees of sky to depths of ugriz~24th mag with the goal of identifying broadly distributed, low surface brightness stellar populations associated with the stellar halos and tidal debris of the Magellanic Clouds. It contains measurements of approximately 360 million objects distributed in discrete fields spanning an area of about 2400 square degrees. The first data release (DR1) contained ~100 million objects from 61 observed fields, while the second data release contains all 360 million objects in 197 fields. Browse these pages to learn more about SMASH and to access the data. The [SMASH overview paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....154..199N/abstract) (Nidever et al. 2017) describes the survey in detail, including its goals, survey strategy, reduction, and calibration.

The **`smash_dr2.object`** table has been crossmatched against some reference datasets (except SDSS due to 0 matches) within a 1.5 arcsec radius, nearest neighbor only. These tables will appear with **x1p5** in their name in our table browser. Example: `smash_dr2.x1p5__object__gaia_dr3__gaia_source`.
